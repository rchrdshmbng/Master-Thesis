They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and ontology inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.[5] Notable examples include OpenAI's GPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT), Google's PaLM (used in Bard), and Meta's LLaMA, as well as BLOOM, Ernie 3.0 Titan, and Anthropic's Claude 2.[/INST]\n",

      "Large language models (LLMs) are sophisticated AI systems that excel in language understanding and generation. They train on vast amounts of data and have billions of parameters, requiring significant computational resources. LLMs are neural networks, often transformers, trained with self-supervised and semi-supervised learning. They predict the next token or word in a text through an autoregressive process. Until 2020, models needed fine-tuning for specific tasks, but larger models like GPT-3 can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. LLMs absorb knowledge from human language corpora, including syntax, semantics, and ontology, but also potential inaccuracies and biases.

      "Examining interdependence between product users users and employees in online user communities : The role of employee - generated content Abstract. Firm - sponsored online user communities have become product innovation and support hubs of strategic importance to firms . Product users and host firm employees comprise the participants of firm - sponsored online user communities . The online user community provides a forum wherein the product users users and firm employees discuss questions , problems or issues resulting from the use of host firms ' products . Extant research on online user communities has largely focused on either product users users or employees and has examined the various dynamics that ensue from each entity 's community participation . This paper seeks to investigate the interdependence between the two entities in the communities and , in particular , how product users users ' reading of employee - generated content influences subsequent knowledge contribution by product users users as well as employees . Analyzing data from an online user community over a two - year period , our study shows that employees whose content is read by product users users generate additional content and product users users who read employee content themselves contribute more knowledge to the community . Thus , the reading of content is not entirely a passive , individual action that only affects the reader . On the contrary , reading sparks additional knowledge contribution by the reader and having readers sparks additional knowledge contribution by the original source of the content , thereby creating a sustainable online user community . Introduction Firm - hosted online user communities ( hereinafter OUC ) refer to firm - sponsored initiatives aiming to help a firm respond to the myriad of questions coming from external product users users ( henceforth , product users users ) while leveraging their knowledge and expertise for existing product support . OUC have the potential to become a real - time , constantly updated product knowledge repository to serve existing product support( Nambisan , 2002 ) . In addition to potentially improving customer loyalty , product and brand perceptions , and lifetime customer value , OUC may also help host - firms cultivate a more customer - centered culture by incorporating customer feedback into decision - making at the executive level( Leidner , 2009 ; , 2002 ) . As a consequence , OUC are of strategic importance to firms . Firms across industries , especially in the high - tech sector , have implemented OUC as a means to support their business strategy( Yan et al . , 2018 ) . SAP , for example , has implemented its OUC ( SAP Community Network ) as part of its platform strategy ( seeHuang et al . , 2018 ) . Examples of other well - known OUC include Salesforce.com 's Trailblazer community , BMC 's Products community and Cisco 's Technology & Support community . A key issue facing firms that seek to capitalize on the strategic value of OUC is ensuring active user participation . A large body of extant OUC research has therefore examined the factors that motivate product users users to participate in and contribute to the communities ( see Table A1 in Appendix ) . Other studies have focused on the role of internal employees ( henceforth , employees ) of the host firms who also participate in OUC . These employees help manage various community challenges including understanding product support requests and identifying best answers( Di Gangi et al . , 2010 ) . Such engagement helps meet product users users ' needs and expectations of product support . As a result , it contributes to product users users ' satisfaction with the community as well as with the host firm( Nambisan , 2002 ) . The participation of employees thereby holds the potential to help sustain and realize value from the community( Nambisan and Baron , 2010 ) . While prior research provides valuable insights into why and how product users users or employees participate in and contribute to the community , we know little about the interdependence between the two entities in OUC . Understanding user - employee interdependence is important because the long - term success of any OUC may be contingent upon both sides of this external / internal duality with the two sides feeding off each other . An OUC serves as a basis for community members to share problems and passions about a topic and , as a result , deepen their knowledge and expertise( Wenger et al . , 2002 ; et al . , 2011 ) . Product users bring a different set of knowledge and experiences to the OUC than do employees . Bringing the two groups together may create complimentary knowledge or may synthesize knowledge in new ways that help solve problems and generate new ideas . Over time , host firm employees and product users users may get to know each other more personally , communicating and coordinating with each other offline . Therefore , focusing exclusively either on product users users or employees and examining each group 's participation in OUC separately may fall short in explaining how to build a thriving OUC . Indeed , scholars have called for studies to better understand employee participation and its relationship to product user participation in the community( Nambisan and Baron , 2010 ) . With this in view , our study seeks to contribute to the existing literature by focusing on employee - generated content and investigating the interdependence between product users users and employees in OUC . Interdependence is a situation in which two or more parties have something of value to each other( Lawler , 2001 ) . In the OUC context , interdependence describes the situation whereby product users users benefit from employee participation while employees and host firms benefit from the participation of product users users . Employee - generated content in OUC refers to the knowledge created and shared by employees across the community for product support . Marketing employees , for example , write blogs to broadcast the launch of new product features and services whereas engineers post technical articles showcasing a particular product design or use process . As companies increase their user base with expanding product lines , employee - generated content in OUC plays a critical role in facilitating product support . Writing community blogs , for example , helps marketing teams collect initial product user questions regarding the new products / features introduced . It also creates opportunities to provide corresponding feedback that may be helpful for prospective product users users sharing the same questions . Autonomous online communities that are independent of any particular firm but are dedicated to the support of one or more companies ' products Communities are established and managed by individuals or groups and consist of product users users of one or more companies in different industries . • Community activities include posting and answering product related questions Reddit 's r / apple ( for Apple products ) ; StackExchange 's ask ubuntu ( for Ubuntu products ) Firm - hosted online branding communities Online communities used by the host firms as marketing instruments to know the thoughts of their product users users and influence the product users users ' purchasing behavior Product users are brought together by common interest and inner admiration for a brand . • Product users express their passion , share their interest and exchange information and knowledge about a specific brand Likewise , detailed technical articles can serve as answers to the issues arising from product users users( Nambisan , 2002 ) . In the present study , we focus on such employee - generated content and examine its impact on the interdependence between product users users and employees in OUC . We next review extant studies on OUC and develop our hypotheses drawing upon the reviewed literature as well as social exchange theory . We then investigate the hypotheses using data from the OUC of BMC , a global leader in producing innovative software solutions . We collected a total of 815 community documents created by 231 employees of BMC in a two - year period . In addition , a total of 12,315 product users users were identified as the readers of the 815 employee - contributed documents . Overall , our results show that readership among product users users of an employee 's content in an OUC has a positive impact on the generation of content by the employee , while the marginal effect is decreasing . And the reading of employee - generated content by a product user is positively related to the subsequent knowledge contribution of the product user . We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of our study for OUC research and practical implications for how firms can build an OUC with the potential to have long - term success in realizing the strategic value of the OUC . Literature review Online user communities can take diverse forms , varying by governance structure ( i.e. , firm - hosted or autonomous ) and community activities . Table 1 presents a comparison of three different forms of OUC that relate to existing product support 1 . In the present study , we focus on firm sponsored OUC because we are interested in the interdependence between product users users and employees of the host firm . As noted earlier , existing literature on firm hosted OUC has tended to explore community dynamics by focusing on either product users users or employees . In terms of product users users , a large body of research has investigated a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations driving product users users ' knowledge contribution in the community . Nambisan and Baron 's research , for example , finds that product users users ' sense of responsibility to the community and anticipated social and hedonic benefits are significantly related to their knowledge contribution( Nambisan and Baron , 2009 , 2010 ) .Gu and Jarvenpaa ( 2003 ) show that product users users ' social identities are associated with knowledge contribution in product support to peers . There are a handful of studies showing that individual characteristics also act as motivators for knowledge contribution in OUC . For instance ,Wiertz and De Ruyter ( 2007 ) find that online interaction propensity is an important individual trait that drives product users users ' knowledge contribution . More recently , research has focused on distinct areas to explain nuanced differences in product users users ' knowledge contribution in the communities .Haas et al . ( 2015 ) , for example , focus on individuals ' attention allocation and show that the features of a particular individual - problem match ( i.e. , expertise fit , problem characteristics , problem crowding ) affect the individual 's choice of specific problems to answer . In terms of employees ( and host firms ) , to the best of our knowledge , related research has focused on three areas . The first area relates to examining the differential outcomes of product user and employee participation in the community . The study ofYan et al . ( 2018 ) shows that answers and suggestions contributed by employees are more likely to be adopted by the host firm than those contributed by product users users . The second area relates to how reactive and proactive attention from host firms affects the extent to which product users users participate in the community .Dahlander and Piezunka ( 2014 ) , for instance , find that host firms that attend to suggestions and answers contributed by product users users are likely to elicit more contributions from product users users . The third area relates to how host firms ' investments in the OUC ( i.e. , having dedicated personnel and encouraging broader employee participation in the community ) influence product users users ' knowledge contribution .Huang et al . ( 2018 ) reveal that host firms that have employees participate in the communities stimulate a higher level of product user contribution than those that do not . Table A1 in the Appendix further summarizes the related studies on OUC . While the extant literature provides valuable insights into the participation of product users users and employees and the resulting outcomes in OUC , it falls short in exploring the potential interdependency between the two entities . As discussed earlier , examining the interdependency between product users users and employees is important because it determines the long - term success of OUC for product support . Indeed , OUC risk suffering from the \" Empty Bar Syndrome \" when they lack active external and/or internal participation and interaction( Ogneva and Kuhl , 2014 ; and Baron , 2010 ) . Hence , this study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on employee - generated content and understanding its impact on user - employee interdependence and knowledge contribution in the community . Social exchange theory and knowledge contribution in OUC To examine the interdependence between product users users and employees , we draw upon social exchange theory ( seeCropanzano and Mitchell 2005 for a recent interdisciplinary review of social exchange theory ) . A social exchange perspective is suited to our study because interdependence is one of the central properties of social exchange( Lawler and Thye , 1999 ) . Social exchange theory is based on the universal norm of reciprocity ( or reciprocal interdependence ) that refers to mutual exchange in a social relationship( Jones , 1976 ; Gouldner , 1960 ) . Based on this reciprocity , social exchange theory explains why individuals exchange resources such as support , information and pleasure( Cropanzano and Mitchell , 2005 ; , 2008 ) . It is one of the fundamental theories for understanding 1 We excluded other online community forms such as open source software development communities and user innovation communities that are focused on open innovation and new product development ( seeYan et al . , 2018 for a detailed comparison of member types and participation activities in those communities ) . helping behavior among individuals . Notably , social exchange differs from economic exchange in that the former often involves intangible resources and assumes the existence of relatively long - term relationships of interest as opposed to short - term and tangible ( e.g. , financial ) exchanges( Molm , 2001 ; et al . , 2018 ) . Social exchanges can either be direct between two individuals or indirect when exchanged within groups( Flynn , 2005 ) . Contributing knowledge to an online community 2 is a form of social exchange that is typically characterized by commitment and reciprocity , intangible costs and benefits ( e.g. , knowledge ) to participants , and the creation and maintenance of social relationships between knowledge contributors and recipients( Emerson , 1981 ; et al . , 2011 ; et al . , 2018 ) . In the OUC context , for example , community members ( product users users and employees of the host firm ) are brought together by shared interests and needs . They post questions and answers publicly and discuss solutions in order to choose the best ones . When members are a part of a supportive group engaging in discussion and experience benefits from the knowledge shared in the OUC , they often develop norms of reciprocity and form strong interpersonal ties with other members( Chiu et al . , 2006 ; , 2008 ; and Cross , 2003 ) . Drawing from the social exchange perspective , we suggest that the reading of employee - generated content by product users users should create norms of reciprocity among product users users . Such norms of reciprocity may facilitate knowledge contribution ( as a form of social exchange ) between community members . Accordingly , we examine 1 ) the impact of reading employee - generated content on product users users ' subsequent knowledge contribution in product support . At the same time , employees may also benefit from product users users reading their content and respond with further knowledge contribution . For example , employees may perceive a greater usefulness or attribute greater value toward their content as they notice a high level of readership of their content ( as discussed in more detail below ) . Hence , we also examine 2 ) the impact of readership among product users users of employee - generated content on employees ' subsequent content generation . Combined , these two investigations allow us to study the interdependence between product users users and employees and the resulting knowledge contribution dynamics in OUC . Hypotheses development In this section , we explain in detail how we expect employee - generated content to affect user - employee interdependence and knowledge contribution in OUC , drawing upon the literature and social exchange theory . Fig . 1 shows the conceptual model of the present study . Reading Employee - Generated content and knowledge contribution of product users users We expect that a product user 's reading of employee - generated content will impact the product user 's knowledge contribution in OUC , based on several aspects of social exchange theory . First , by reading employee content , a product user is able to learn and absorb the explicit knowledge contained in the content . This benefit of expertise and knowledge enhancement should encourage helping behavior and a sense of obligation to reciprocate .Nahapiet and Ghoshal ( 1998 ) suggest that cognitive benefits ( e.g. , knowledge and learning ) obtained by individuals in a group should promote reciprocity among group members and thereby impact their sense of obligation and responsibility to help others . This is also consistent with the findings of much OUC research which suggests that assisting others would establish or reinforce member 's expertise - based reputation in the community ( e.g. ,Nambisan and Baron , 2007 2009 . Second , employees provide product users users access to quality content by writing and sharing reviews and articles in the community . This should help augment product users users ' loyalty and obligation toward the community because product users users feel rewarded for their participation( Nambisan , 2002 ) . Loyalty toward the community has been found to impact the willingness to cooperate in product support initiatives( Kosonen et al . , 2013 ; et al . , 2002 ) .Kosonen et al . ( 2013 ) , for example , demonstrate that product users users ' loyalty toward the host firm is positively associated with their intention to contribute knowledge to the community . Moreover , in many cases , product users users not only read employee articles but interact with the authors by leaving comments , questions and opinions . The positive feelings arising from such interactions should shape product users users ' perceptions and attitudes ( e.g. , attachment and identification ) towards the host firm( Nambisan and Baron , 2009 , 2010 ) . This , as indicated by social exchange theory ( see Hall , 2001 , p.15 ) , 2 In this study we delimit the concept of knowledge to explicit and documented knowledge ( e.g. , posted answers , discussions , and articles ) that is easy to communicate and share . should motivate product users users to contribute knowledge in product support . Third , based on our literature review , the feature of allowing employees to contribute their knowledge via writing blogs and technical notes should , over time , facilitate the creation of repository - based knowledge . The greater host firms incorporate design features that relate to collective knowledge acquisition and distribution , the greater the likelihood that product users users will participate in product support activities( Benlian and Hess , 2011 ; , 2002 ) . In addition , with community search tools , this collective knowledge from employees will be especially instrumental in benefiting newcomers and thereby boosting their attachment to the community( Ren et al . , 2007 ; and Bagozzi , 2014 ) . Taken together , we expect that the more a product user reads employee content , the more likely the product user is to contribute knowledge in subsequent product support , leading to the following hypothesis : Hypothesis ( H1 ) : . A product user 's reading of employee - generated content in an OUC will be positively related to the product user 's knowledge contribution in product support . Readership of Employee - Generated content and knowledge contribution of employees Employees in OUC are likely to continue to generate contenti.e . , knowledge contributionwhen they benefit from doing so . One important factor that can lead to benefits perceived by employees is readership 3 . This is because in OUC employees write blogs , reviews and technical articles in the hope that their contributed content will be useful for product users users looking for product support . The level of readership is one indicator of how popular the content is and whether the content is of value to product users users . Employees may attribute greater value to their content or perceive it as having greater usefulness when they notice it has a high level of readership . Such perceptions of content usefulness and valuei.e . , soft rewards in social exchange theory( Hall , 2001 ) -may then inspire employees to contribute more content . In addition , readership in an online setting is not only indicated by the number of views but also by the number of incoming ties . Members can , for example , choose to bookmark the content they like and/or follow the content authors ( i.e. , incoming ties ) , so that they will be notified of updates to existing content and/or of new content from the authors they follow . Employees who receive a surge of incoming ties after posting an article may attribute this to the high popularity of their content , motivating them to contribute more( Phang et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , contributing highly read content and thereby receiving a high number of connections should enhance one 's recognition and reputation in the community ( i.e. , provide reputational benefits ) . In the OUC of BMC , for example , receiving new bookmarks and followings increases a member 's community points , which reflect the member 's overall community reputation and recognition( Phang et al . , 2014 ) . Such reputational benefits may , in turn , serve as an extrinsic motivation to contribute knowledge( Hall , 2001 ) . We therefore expect that an employee with higher readership will tend to generate more content . However , based on the principle of diminishing returns 4 , we expect that the effect of readership on content generation should become weaker once an employee 's content has already attained high readership . For example , receiving 50 more views of their content should matter less for an employee whose content has already had 5,000 views than for an employee whose content has had only five views . In other words , an employee who has already contributed a great deal of popular content may not be as motivated to contribute more after seeing his / her content readership increases compared to one who has only contributed very little . Indeed , theGoes et al . ( 2014 ) study suggests that expert reviewers with an extremely high following may not be as incentivized to write more product reviews by gaining new followers as other reviewers are . Taken together , we hypothesize the following : Hypothesis ( H2 ) : . Readership among product users users of an employee 's content in an OUC will be positively related to the content generation of the employee ; the marginal effect of readership on content generation , however , should be decreasing . Methodology Context and data collection We selected the OUC of BMC as our empirical setting . Headquartered in Houston , Texas , BMC is a global leader in innovative software solutions that enable businesses to transform into digital enterprises for competitive advantage ( BMC , 2020 ) . As of 2019 , BMC had delivered software , services , and expertise to help more than 10,000 customers , including 92 % of the Forbes Global 100( BMC , 2020 ) . In 2002 , BMC established its OUC through which it has developed a successful , long - term relationship with its product users users . We chose BMC as our empirical context not only because it was one of the first to build an online community for employees to participate in product support but also because the executives of BMC have worked to embed the community within the organizational culture ( seeSilvano and Laurenceau , 2019 ) . Based on our interview with the community manager , almost all BMC employees are encouraged to participate in the community for product support . While employees from different functions may have different motivations , their participation in the community 3 Readership in an online setting often refers to the number of views ( readings or connections ) per article or written document and has been examined in several studies that focus on employee - or user - generated content ( e.g. ,Singh et al . , 2014 ; et al . , 2012 ; and Ransbotham , 2016 ) . 4 The law of diminishing returns ( or diminishing marginal productivity ) fits the situation where producing one more unit of output ( e.g. , content ) will require increasingly more inputs ( e.g. , readership ) when the inputs become less and less effective . A related study can be found inMcfadyen and Cannella ( 2004 ) . remains voluntary . Apart from directly answering questions from product users users , employees of BMC contribute content to the community via writing documents . Employee documents largely focus on the description , explanation , use and application of product functions and features . We excluded the documents related to new product announcement ( e.g. , release date , product category ) as those are irrelevant to product functions and features . Our data collection process relates to three entities examined in this study : employee - generated content ( documents ) , employees ( authors ) and product users users ( readers ) . We started our data collection by identifying employee - contributed documents through which we further accessed and collected the data of authors and readers . For this study , we collected all the documents generated by employees in a two - year period , from January 2014 to January 2016 5 . For each document , we recorded the link to the author 's community profile , and the interaction data for the document including views , viewers , comments , likes and bookmarks . Community profiles include employees ' demographic data , network data ( e.g. , following / followers ) , participation data ( e.g. , discussion and document contributions ) , and reputation data ( e.g. , points and levels ) . Through the menus such as \" Content \" , \" Connections \" and \" Reputation \" in the profile , members can access more detailed information such as the discussions and threads in which they have participated and the profiles of the people following them . The entire process generated a total of 815 documents contributed by 231 employees , and a total of 12,315 readers ( individuals who had accessed the documents ) . Table 2 summarizes the demographic data of the 231 employees . Variables and Measures Overall , there are four major variables investigated in this study : readership among product users users , reading by a product user , knowledge contribution of a product user , and knowledge contribution of an employee . To measure readership among product users users ( aggregate readership ) , we utilized each document 's interaction data because the number of views , likes , comments and bookmarks objectively reflects the amount of readership of a document . Nevertheless , several behavioral factors were considered when we measured the variable using the interaction data . For example , using the number of views alone may not truly represent a document 's readership because many readers may only take a rapid glance or skim through the document . Likewise , a record of like , bookmark and comment may come from the same reader rather than from different individuals ; and many readers may not take any action ( e.g. , like , bookmark , comment ) after reading a document . Further , a document receiving 100 comments should be more popular than the one receiving only 100 likes and no comments . Taking the above factors into account , we measured the variable by calculating a readership factor score based on the number of \" likes \" , \" bookmarks \" and \" comments \" that each document received . The three - factor score was calculated in SPSS using the regression method 6 . The reading by a product user ( individual reading ) was gathered from the community profile data and measured using the number of documents the product user commented , liked and/or bookmarked during the two - year period ( we assume a product user had , to some extent , read the document before commenting , liking or bookmarking ) . An employee 's content generation ( i.e. , knowledge contribution of an employee ) was gathered from the employee 's community profile and measured as the number of documents the employee generated and shared during the two - year period . One challenge in measuring a product user 's knowledge contribution in product support is that the relationship between product users users ' reading behavior and their corresponding knowledge contribution behavior is unobservable . For example , when a product user contributes knowledge to a discussion , it is difficult to distinguish whether his / her motivation to contribute results from reading employee content . Furthermore , the source of contributed expertise and knowledge is unclear : it may either come from the product users users themselves or from the employee content that they have read . To overcome this obstacle , we utilized the record of incoming links of each document . The incoming links contain the citation history of each document ( a link to the document will appear in the discussion threads when a product user cites it ) . Through these links , we were able to find out when , where and by whom the document was cited since the time it was first posted in the community . The citation itself not only reflects a product user 's reading behavior but also indicates the knowledge source behind the contribution . Hence , for each product user , the knowledge contribution in product support was measured 5 We selected this time period because 2014~2016 was the latest period for data collection when the leading author was working on his dissertation . And we chose a 2-year time interval to be in line with previous studies ( e.g. ,Singh et al . , 2014 ; et al . , 2018 ) . 6 In regression , independent variables are the standardized observed values of the items in the estimated factors ( i.e. , likes , bookmarks and comments )( DiStefano et al . , 2009 ) . The dependent variables are the factor scores . We also standardized the computed factor scores to a mean of 0.38 to avoid negative values ( see Table 4 ) . by the number of citations s / he made in the discussion threads . One limitation of this measure is that it does not take into account the knowledge contribution of product users users that was based on employee content but did not cite the content . We therefore included discussion quantity as a control variable . Discussion quantity was measured by counting the total discussion replies of a product user . In addition to discussion quantity , we included several other control variables . For both employees and product users users , we controlled for community tenure . Community tenure was calculated in months based on each member 's profile data . For the employees , we also controlled for their writing experience as suggested by prior research ( e.g. ,Boudreau , 2012 ) . Writing experience equals the total number of documents an employee has contributed prior to the post of his / her latest document . For product users users , we also controlled for their place scope . Place scope counts the number of distinct places 7 where a product user has participated in product support . Some product users users focus their participation on only one or two places whereas others span multiple places . Prior research indicates that the degree of boundary spanning impacts product users users ' knowledge contribution ( e.g. ,Dahlander and Frederiksen , 2012 ) . Finally , we included new product release as an important control variable to account for potential omitted - variable bias regarding the impact of readership on knowledge contribution . Specifically , we expect that an employee is likely to contribute new content not only because of the increase of readership but also because of the release of new products / versions from the host firm . In other words , participating employees may be more motivated to write and discuss new products / versions than existing ones . To measure this variable , we accessed the product history database of BMC and downloaded the product release history data from January 2014 to January 2016 . We then , by month , counted the total number of releases pertaining to each product category . Modeling strategy We constructed a panel data to take account of potential endogeneity issues , such as omitted variables and reverse causality . For example , while participation is voluntary , employees from different functions may possess different types and levels of motivation to contribute their knowledge . Also , some employees contribute more content than others simply because their personal characteristics or levels of expertise and knowledge enable them to do so . As such , constructing a panel data allows us to control for these individual fixed - effects and to mitigate omitted variable bias( Greene , 2011 ) . Furthermore , our unique context features and data sources help us mitigate some reverse causality bias . For example , product users users ' reading behavior should logically precede their citation of the material they have read . Causality is less clear for employees : they may choose to write more with the intent of benefiting from increasing readership and incoming ties ( i.e. , increasing their reputation in the community ) . To account for this potential reverse causality , we measured readership prior to measuring employees ' writing behavior . If readership does influence writing , the predetermined change of readership should have a significant impact . The extent to which an employee 's documents are read by product users users in the community The interaction data of the documents generated by the employee The readership factor score based on the number of \" likes \" , \" bookmarks \" and \" comments \" that a document received An employee 's content generation ( bookmarks\" and \"comments\" that a document received An employee's content generation ) The extent to which an employee contributes new documents to the community Online profile data of the employee The number of documents an employee generated and contributed Reading by a product user ( Individual_Reading ) The extent to which a product user reads employee documents in the community Online profile data of the product user The number of documents a product user commented , liked and/0r bookmarked A product user 's knowledge contribution ( number of documents a product user commented, liked and/0r bookmarked A product user's knowledge contribution ) The extent to which a product user contributes to product support using information and knowledge derived from employee - contributed documents The citation history contained in the record of incoming links of each document The number of citations a product user made in the discussion threads Discussion quantity ( citations a product user made in the discussion threads END_PARAGRAPH_TAG START_SECTION_TAG Discussion quantity ) The extent to which a product user has participated in the product support discussions Online profile data of the product user The total number of discussion replies of a product user Community tenure ( total number of discussion replies of a product user Community tenure ) The time period a product user or an employee has been a member of the community Online profile data of the product user and employee The number of months since the registration of a product user or an employee Writing experience ( number of months since the registration of a product user or an employee Writing experience ) The extent to which an employee had contributed documents to the community Online profile data of the employee The total number of documents an employee has contributed prior to the post of his / her latest document Place scope ( the post of his/her latest document Place scope ) The extent to which a product user spans communities Online profile data of the product user The number of distinct places in which a product user has participated in product support New product release ( which a product user has participated in product support New product release ) The extent to which the host firm releases new products The product history database of BMC We constructed the panel data set at two different levels , author ( employees ) and reader ( product users users ) , to test our hypotheses . At the author level , we constructed author - month pairs from January 2014 to January 2016 . In this panel , readership among product users users was entered for each author by summing up the readership factor score of all the documents of the author in the current month . The dependent variable of employee content generation was entered for each author - month pair by counting the number of new documents the author posted in the next month . For the control variables , writing experience was calculated as the number of documents an author had contributed up to the current month . New product release was entered by counting the total number of releases that occurred in the current month . At the reader level , we constructed reader - month pairs for the two - year period . For each reader , the variable of reading by a product user was calculated by counting the total number of documents the reader commented , liked and/or bookmarked during that month . Then the dependent variable of knowledge contribution in product support was entered by counting the citations the product user made in the same month . The control variable of place scope was calculated as the number of distinct places in which a product user had participated in that month . We also entered and controlled for the total number of discussion replies a product user contributed in the month ( i.e. discussion quantity ) , as discussed earlier . Finally , for both authors and readers , we calculated community tenure in the panels to account for time effects . Table 3 summarizes all the variables discussed earlier and investigated in the panel models of this study . Estimation approach We chose to estimate a negative binomial ( negative binomial ) fixed - effects panel model , over a Poisson model , considering that our two dependent variables ( i.e. , # new documents and # citations ) are both count variables and our data 's sample variances are much larger than sample means ( i.e. , over - dispersed ) . In addition , we added a zero - inflation part because of excess zeros in the dependent variables( Greene , 2011 ) . The existence of excess zeros also has some implications . The online community literature has introduced the concept of lurkers and investigated their community behaviors 8 . Drawing upon this concept , we suggest that zeros could result from two different groups of individuals . One group is participating product users users who yield zero citations because they do not cite employee content in a particular time period ( contribute zero documents in that month zeros ) . The other group behaves like lurkers ; they may have read the content and acquired the required knowledge but do not intend to ever contribute such knowledge in any discussions and therefore always have zero contributions ( the excess zeros ) . Likewise , employees , while can not be called as lurkers , have zero outcomes because they happen to contribute zero documents in that month ( contribute zero documents in that month zeros ) or they may have left the community or are no longer interested in contributing any community content ( the excess zeros ) . We therefore chose to estimate a full zero - inflated negative binomial fixed - effects ( zero-inflated negative binomial fixed-effects ) model for both panels . The zero-inflated negative binomial fixed-effects model assumes that two distinct processes generate zeros : one process generates only zeros ( lurking ) and the other process ( participatinga count process ) generates both zero and non - zero counts Accordingly , the zero-inflated negative binomial fixed-effects regression entails two models : a count model -NB modelto model the count process , and a logit model to differentiate the two processes generating the zero outcomes( Greene , 2011 ) . We used a conditional estimator inHausman et al . ( 1984 ) to estimate the negative binomial fixed - effects panel model : logLc = ∑ n i=1 logP(yi1 , yi2 , ⋯ , yiTi| ∑ Ti t=1 yit)(1 ) under this estimator , the model framework for the author panel is : E[yit|xi ( t-1)) 1 + exp(γ'Zi ) ] = exp(δi + β ' xi ( t-1)) 1 + exp(γ'Zi ) ) = λit(2 ) The model framework for the reader panel is : E[yit|xit ] = exp(δi + β ' xit ) = λit(3 ) where t is the time periods ( i.e. , 24 months from January 2014 to January 2016 ) ; i is the individual observations ; x i is an m × 1 vector of explanatory variables and β ' is an m × 1 vector of corresponding coefficients( Hausman et al . , 1984 ) ; δ i is the error term . This negative binomial fixed - effects part models the individuals who behave as participants in the community . For those who may behave as lurkers , they are modeled by the logit part of the zero-inflated negative binomial fixed-effects model . Specifically , we have y it = 0 with probability φ it ( behaving as lurkers ) , and have y it = λ it ( negative binomial estimate from formula ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) ) with probability 1φ it : φit = exp(γ'Zi ( t-1)) 1 + exp(γ'Zi ) ) 1 + exp(γ'Zi ( t-1)) 1 + exp(γ'Zi ) ) ( Author ) φit = exp(γ'Zit ) 1 + exp(γ'Zit ) ( Reader ) where z i is a q × 1 vector of explanatory variables in the logit model and γ ' is a q × 1 vector of corresponding coefficients( Hausman et al . , 1984 ) .

Table 4 shows the correlations and descriptive statistics of the two panel datasets . Table 5 presents the results from the author panel . The positive α value indicates the over - dispersion of the dataset and supports the use of negative binomial model over a Poisson model . The results of Hausman test ( p < 0.001 ) favor the fixed - effects over the random effect . The positive and significant coefficient of aggregate readership ( negative binomial Part Model 3 , β = 0.778 , p < 0.001 ) supports the positive effect of readership on new document generation . Specifically , the results show that with one unit increase in aggregate readership , an employee will on average generate 0.8 more new documents in the subsequent month . The negative and significant coefficient of the quadratic term of aggregate readership ( negative binomial Part Model 3 , β = -0.057 , p < 0.001 ) indicates that the effect of aggregate readership on new document generation is weaker for those employees whose content has already received much readership than those whose content has only received a little . Combined , the results related to readership in Tables 5 support H2 . Notably , the estimates of the control variable ( which a product user has participated in product support New product release ) in Table 5 are all positive and significant , indicating that as new products / versions are released , employees are more likely to write new documents . Table 6 presents the results from the reader panel . The positive and significant coefficient of reading by a product user ( Individual Reading ) ( negative binomial Part Model 2 , β = 0.474 , p < 0.001 ) indicates that reading employee - generated documents of a product user positively affects the product user 's knowledge contribution in product support . Specifically , the results show that with one unit increase in reading , a product user will on average contribute 0.5 more citations in product support . H1 is therefore supported . Variables Results Regarding the logit models , we used the variables of writing experience and place scope to predict an employee 's excess zeros and a product user 's lurking behavior , respectively . The negative and significant coefficient of writing experience ( number of months since the registration of a product user or an employee Writing experience ) in Table 5 ( Logit Part Model 3 , β = − 0.921 , p < 0.001 ) indicates that employees who have previously been active in generating documents are less likely to produce \" excess zeros \" . Similarly , the coefficient of place scope ( the post of his/her latest document Place scope ) in Table 6 is negative and significant ( Logit Part Model 2 , β = − 1.941 , p < 0.001 ) . This indicates that product users users who participate in multiple community places are less likely to behave as lurkers , compared to those product users users who focus their participation on only one place . This result is , to some extent , consistent with findings from prior studies showing that product users users who engage in a high degree of community spanning are more likely to engage in entrepreneurial action ( e.g. , sell company products in the community )( Autio et al . , 2013 ) . It also relates to the findings of studies that reveal a positive relationship between participating in different communities and the innovativeness of a product user ( e.g. ,Dahlander and Frederiksen , 2012 ; and Waguespack , 2007 ) . Discussion This study extends the OUC literature by focusing on employee - generated content and examining its impact on user - employee interdependence and knowledge contribution in the communities . Our study has overall found that readership among product users users of an employee 's content in an OUC leads to additional knowledge contribution by the employee , despite the decreasing marginal effect , and that a product user 's reading of employee - generated content leads to knowledge contribution by the product user . Our results accordingly have both theoretical and practical implications . Theoretical implications Our study offers several important theoretical implications . First and foremost , our findings imply that examining user - employee interaction is imperative to understanding the participation dynamics and success of OUC . On the one hand , participating employees and their contribution to the community ( such as supplying community content ) should elicit more contributions from product users users . On the other hand , as employees observe positive outcomes ( such as increasing readership among product users users resulting from their contribution ) they are more motivated to engage in the community and willing to contribute more . Such a positive , spiral interaction pattern between employees and product users users is essential for building a thriving community( Butler , 2001 ; et al . , 2011 ; et al . , 2019 ) . Much research is hence needed to examine the interaction and relationship between product users users and employees and illustrate how the resulting outcomes contribute to the long - term success of OUC . Second , our study sheds light on the choice of community management and investment strategies( Huang et al . , 2018 ; and Baron , 2010 ) . Specifically , our findings suggest that employees with different participation levels respond differently to the changing readership of contributed content . Compared to employees positioned within the periphery of an OUC , employees who have contributed a large amount of popular content and thereby are positioned within the core of the OUC would be less likely to be affected by changing readership due to the principle of diminishing returns discussed earlier . Increasing the number of incoming employees who just joined the community ( versus increasing the participation level of existing employees ) as a community investment strategy may be more effective because incoming employees ( who are in the periphery of the community ) would be more likely to be motivated to contribute after interacting with product users users . Also , while previous studies have shown that having participating employees attend to requests of product users users has become a major strategy for host firms to nurture contributions from product users users , our study suggests some new theoretical mechanisms behind the effectiveness of such strategy . Specifically , our findings show that while reading community documents contributed by participating employees facilitates the knowledge contribution of product users users , readership by product users users of employee - contributed content will , in turn , affect employees ' knowledge contribution . Reciprocity ( or reciprocal interdependence ) may therefore be a more appropriate term to reveal the nature and potential of the strategy . This is different from prior studies that often explain the strategy effectiveness by only focusing on product users users ' trust in the host firm and their capacity to contribute ( e.g. ,Dahlander and Piezunka , 2014 ; et al . , 2018 ) . Our last theoretical implication concerns the contribution behaviors of employees and product users users in OUC . For employees , this research extends our understanding of what motivates employees to contribute by focusing on how behaviors ( e.g. , readership ) encourage other behaviors ( extends our understanding of what motivates employees to contribute by focusing on how behaviors (e.g., readership) encourage other behaviors , contribution ) . Our findings suggest that an important factor driving continued knowledge contribution by an employee is the aggregate readership among product users users of the employee 's content . This is different from previous research that uncovered the desire to help others to motivate knowledge contribution ( e.g. ,Wendelken et al . , 2014 ; and Faraj , 2000 ) . Our research suggests that it is not enough to desire to help others , one must also see evidence that one 's actions ( e.g. , knowledge contribution ) are actually helping , or at the very least being seen ( e.g. , read by product users users ) . For product users users , our research also reveals a new behavioral mechanism , specifically reading content generated by employees as driving subsequent contribution by product users users . This is different from previous research that as discussed earlier , has largely focused on mechanisms such as trust , social identity , and interaction propensity . Future research is needed to examine and compare the conditions under which employees are likely to be motivated to contribute with those of product users users . Practical implications From a practical perspective , our study provides some suggestions that might assist in building a vibrant and thriving OUC . First , we suggest that host firms develop a strategic vision and plan to build the level and scope of employee participation . This is essential because as discussed earlier , employee participation and contribution play a critical role in facilitating community learning which in turn influences product users users ' knowledge contribution to peers . In addition , participating employees could act as connectors and influencers in the community and thereby help product users users develop social connectedness and a sense of community( Yan et al . , 2018 ) . One important step that host firms could employ to increase employee participation is targeting executives and senior management as internal champions( Dahl et al . , 2011 ) . Their initial participation and subsequent behavior in the community would not only galvanize the rest of the firm to join but also help form community culture and impact incoming employees( Barrett et al . , 2016 ; et al . , 2012 ) . Second , once overall employee engagement is achieved , host firms should adopt a more open business strategy in order to encourage participating employees to create and share high quality content ( e.g. , technical articles ) . This open business strategy differs from traditional business strategy in that the open business strategy may not claim ownership over firm resources and allow others to copy and use them( Chesbrough and Appleyard , 2007 ; et al . , 2017 ; et al . , 2011 ) . For example , many technical articles created by BMC 's participating employees contain a significant amount of the source code behind the company 's proprietary software products . Product users can not only learn from this shared source code in the community but are also allowed to modify and apply it in their own products . This can generate valuable modifications and applications which may later be adopted in the company 's new releases . This is similar to some open source software communities where various open business models are employed by corporate sponsors when they design the communities ( seeDahlander and Magnusson , 2005 ; and O'Mahony , 2008 ; et al . , 2016 ) . How host firms can actively integrate the OUC and product users users into their strategy processes ( i.e. , utilize the OUC and product users users to help achieve strategic goals such as new knowledge creation and innovation ) deserves future research . Conclusion To conclude , the present study extends existing research on firm - hosted online user communities by focusing on community content contributed by participating employees . Our findings indicate that employee - generated content such as technical articles plays a critical role in facilitating the knowledge contribution of product users users to the community . In addition , the continuance of employee content generation is driven , in part , by the level of product users users ' reading of existing content . To better utilize these findings , we suggest that host firms develop a strategic vision and plan to increase the level and scope of employee participation . Not only can participating employees help moderate community dynamics but they can also contribute to the long - term success and sustainability of the communities by interacting with product users users for better product support .

On the contrary , reading sparks additional knowledge contribution by the reader and having readers sparks additional knowledge contribution by the original source of the content , thereby creating a sustainable online user community .

Understanding user - employee interdependence is important because the long - term success of any OUC may be contingent upon both sides of this external / internal duality with the two sides feeding off each other . An OUC serves as a basis for community members to share problems and passions about a topic and , as a result , deepen their knowledge and expertise( Wenger et al . , 2002 ; et al . , 2011 ) . Product users bring a different set of knowledge and experiences to the OUC than do employees .

The researchers chose the BMC OUC as their empirical setting. BMC is a leader in software solutions that helps businesses transform into digital enterprises, with a presence in over 10,000 customers worldwide, including 92% of the Forbes Global 100. In 2002, BMC established its OUC, creating a successful and long-term relationship with its product users. The study selected BMC as it was an early adopter of online communities for employee participation in product support. [INST] <<SYS>>\n",

In an interview with the community manager, it is revealed that almost all BMC employees are encouraged to participate in the community for product support. Though employees may have varying motivations depending on their functions, their involvement in the community is significant. The concept of readership in an online setting is described, which is related to the number of views or engagements with an article or written document in studies that focus on user-generated content (e.g., Singh et al., 2014; et al., 2012; Ransbotham, 2016). The law of diminishing returns is mentioned, where producing more output requires more inputs, but these inputs become less effective as the process continues, as seen in McFadyen and Cannella (2004).

For example , using the number of views alone may not truly represent a document 's readership because many readers may only take a rapid glance or skim through the document . Likewise , a record of like , bookmark and comment may come from the same reader rather than from different individuals ; and many readers may not take any action ( e.g. , like , bookmark , comment ) after reading a document .

These metrics objectively reflect the readership of a document. However, it's crucial to consider various behavioral factors, such as the possibility of one-time glances or skimming, duplicate actions from a single reader, and the absence of any action. Additionally, the number of comments indicates higher popularity compared to likes and no comments. Thus, a readership factor score is calculated based on these factors to accurately measure readership. [/INST] [INST] <<SYS>>\n",

      " The Paper focuses on an Agent Mediated Knowledge in Motion Model within the context of millions invested in Knowledge Management. Researchers in this field explore how firms can organize their processes to reap benefits, yet most research is fragmented and over-emphasizes knowledge creation, with little attention to key intermediaries in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proposed Agent Mediated Knowledge in Motion Model embodies a cycle of knowledge creation and reuse, tying agent-based research to knowledge creation and application. Organizations can strategically employ human and software agents to enhance the creation, transfer, application, and dissemination of knowledge in the process. The paper highlights specific roles and attributes of various agents in the knowledge management process, using the organization as the primary unit of analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of discussion revolves around the conceptualization of an Agent Mediated Knowledge Management process, where data is transformed into information, information into knowledge, knowledge into creativity, creativity into innovation, and finally the diffusion of innovation into data. This cycle links knowledge transitions from creation to reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Existing research has attempted to answer the 'why' of knowledge creation and application, explicating how knowledge is transformed from creation to application. However, there  The Agent-Mediated Knowledge in Motion model involves two primary activities - knowledge creation and knowledge application. Knowledge creation focuses on using agents to explore and extract data and information, transforming it into useful knowledge for creative venturing. Knowledge application, on the other hand, concentrates on utilizing other sets of agents to exploit the knowledge into creativity and innovations and their subsequent diffusion for appropriation and reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the knowledge creation activity, the information acquisition episode deals with transforming raw data into meaningful information. Data becomes relevant information when it is placed within a context, is timely, structured, and useful in the organizational context. Firms use various search mechanisms to query and retrieve data, filtering it based on contextual relevance. Irrelevant data is treated as noise, and firms implement noise reduction strategies using effective data filtering, structuring, and standardization techniques. This process adds value by \"informating\" - the transformation of dispersed data into specific information for a more penetrating, comprehensive, and insightful understanding of the business.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the knowledge application activity, there are three episodes - promotion and synthesis of creativity from knowledge, transformation of creative ideas into innovation, and diffusion of innov  The text discusses the process of transforming information into knowledge, focusing on both tacit and explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is objective and rational, while tacit knowledge is cognitive and experiential. Knowledge agents play a crucial role in translating information into knowledge, acting as intermediaries between different information sources and knowledge domains within an organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software-based knowledge agents use rule-based reasoning and combination to extract non-redundant information, creating explicit knowledge for reuse. Human knowledge agents, on the other hand, use socialization and externalization to capture tacit knowledge and convert it into explicit knowledge. They create personalized knowledge by transferring tacit knowledge across domains for organizational reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The economic value of knowledge is realized through creativity and innovation, which extend an organization's knowledge base. Organizations must actively promote creativity to effectively manage knowledge, involving and motivating all members to act as creative contributors. Creativity agents serve as task coordinators, bridging knowledge gaps and fostering creativity through coordination and integration. They align distributed cross-functional knowledge, coordinate the development of ideas across functions, and integrate creative concepts derived from individuals and organizational collectives to generate a rich  To summarize: The text discusses the role of innovation agents as ambassadors in transforming creativity into innovations within organizations. These agents assess creative concepts, prioritize and champion innovation projects, and ensure selective diffusion of innovations for economic returns without compromising appropriability and competitive advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "They evaluate the feasibility of concepts, the commercial and customer benefits, and potential risks related to introducing a concept as an innovation in the value chain. Innovation agents also allocate resources and protect projects from interference during development and implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The selective diffusion of innovations involves sharing certain aspects as knowledge and data, maintaining the continuity of knowledge, and allowing for reuse and recreation. Organizational executives are well-suited to play the role of diffusion guards, controlling and directing the flow of innovation data and knowledge. They analyze market trends, delineate critical and non-critical parts of an innovation, and regulate dissemination according to organizational objectives.\n",

      "In addition to controlling diffusion, innovation agents also direct it by mapping paths and resources required for intra-organizational diffusion of innovation knowledge and data. They ensure that mission-critical innovation data is circulated internally and transformed into information for  The Paper discusses an Agent Mediated Knowledge in Motion Model in the context of Knowledge Management. It emphasizes the dynamic, transitional nature of knowledge and how agents, either software or human, play crucial roles in creating, transforming, applying, and diffusing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model suggests that to maintain the cycle of knowledge creation, application, and dissemination, organizations need to consider using different types of agents for specific phases of knowledge management. Agents are responsible for bridging knowledge transitions, leveraging their situatedness within the knowledge management process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software agents are advantageous for phases requiring objective criteria and modularity, while human agents are better suited for phases that require subjective complexities of reinterpretation and recontextualization. Agents in knowledge management play various roles, such as scouting data, translating information into knowledge, coordinating knowledge into creativity, championing innovation projects, and selectively diffusing innovations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper also emphasizes the need for knowledge application in addition to knowledge creation. While knowledge creation is a necessary condition for achieving competitive advantage, it is not sufficient. Organizations must effectively assimilate, apply, and disseminate knowledge in their everyday practice to generate economic  The text discusses agent-mediated knowledge transformations and their measurement based on quality or quantity outcomes. It raises the question if specific knowledge management transitions require unique metrics and if these metrics differ across organizations and industries. The model presented, known as the agent-mediated knowledge in motion, is an idealized theoretical framework that portrays knowledge transitions as discrete phases or episodes. However, reality often shows overlapping degrees between these phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model assumes that knowledge transitions are deterministic, with a chain of prior transformations causally determining future ones. The study suggests that more granular examination of specific knowledge state transitions could provide benefits for research and practice. It also questions the boundaries of knowledge creation and application, asking whether there are distinct markers and if knowledge transitions are fuzzy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper further examines agents as catalysts for knowledge transformations. While more agents can positively influence knowledge transitions, there's a risk of the \"tragedy of the commons,\" leading to diminishing returns as resources become limited. The presence and availability of agents do contribute to knowledge transformation, but managing the agents becomes more challenging as more are introduced.\n",
